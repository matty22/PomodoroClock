# Pomodoro Clock

This pomodoro clock provides a quick way to get motivated for the user. The user can adjust their work and break interval lengths and start their studies or chores knowing that they have a break coming up soon!

## To Use

Use the work and break interval + and - buttons to adjust the length of those intervals. The Start, Pause, and Reset buttons will do just as their name implies.
